We develop and implement software to suit your needs and offer flexibility in programing
languages. However our specialization is in C++ and Python. Currently the software portfolio 
includes the following programs and libraries:

  * [gsof2ew](https://github.com/Boritech-Solutions/GSOF2EW)
    * gsof2ew is a program created by BoriTech Solutions that provides the ability of a 
    RTX enabled Trimble GPS reciever to provide Precise Point Positioning data directly to an Earthworm system.
  * [bnc2ew](https://github.com/Boritech-Solutions/BNC2EW)
    * BNC is a program developed by the BKG GNSS Datacenter that creates 
    Precise Point Positioning by post-processing RINEX data. It has been adapted by BoriTech Solutions 
    to allow for data to be placed directly into an Earthworm system.
  * [PyEarthWorm](https://github.com/Boritech-Solutions/PyEarthWorm)
    * PyEarthWorm is a python interface to the Earthworm Messaging Transport system. 
    It seeks to create an easy to use framework to create modern earthworm modules with python.
    The extension allows you to easily connect to any earthworm memory ring directly and extract messages
