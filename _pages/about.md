# Program portfolio
We develop and implement software to suit your need. We offer flexibility in programing
languages although we specialize in C++ and Python. Currently our software portfolio 
includes the following programs:

  * [gsof2ew](https://github.com/Boritech-Solutions/GSOF2EW)
    * gsof2ew is a program created by BoriTech Solutions that provides the ability of a 
    RTX enabled Trimble GPS receiver to provide Precise Point Positioning data directly to an Earthworm system.
  * [bnc2ew](https://github.com/Boritech-Solutions/BNC2EW)
    * BNC is a program developed by the BKG GNSS Datacenter that creates 
    Precise Point Positioning by post-processing RINEX data. It has been modified by BoriTech Solutions 
    to allow for data to be placed directly into an Earthworm system.
